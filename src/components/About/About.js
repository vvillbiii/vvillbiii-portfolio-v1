        <p>
          A software engineer with a background in SEO and digital marketing.
          Finding new ways to solve problems and learning new skills are
          interests of mine. In addition to solving problems independently, I
          value collaboration because there is more than one way to achieve an
          answer, and everyoneâ€™s input is valuable. My strengths are my
          attention to detail and my ability to meet deadlines.
