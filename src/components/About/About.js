            <p>
              I'm software engineer with a background in SEO and digital
              marketing. Finding new ways to solve problems and learning new
              skills are interests of mine.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In addition to solving problems independently, I value
              collaboration because there is more than one way to achieve an
              answer, and everyoneâ€™s input is valuable. My strengths are my
              attention to detail and my ability to meet deadlines.
